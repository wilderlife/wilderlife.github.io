Hiking in Yosemite was definitely one of the biggest hits whilist travelling through West Coast America. After 3 days there I wish I'd stayed for weeks.

If you're looking to find out how to enjoy Yosemite off the beaten track, without thousands of tourists and actually do some proper hiking - this post is for you. If you want to just enjoy the Yosemite Village, I won't cover much about it here, but check out this blog post by xyz. 

1. Equipment!

If you're planning to arrive from the overseas, just as I did, you probably don't want carry all the equipment with you. Unless you're planning to spend most of your trip in the tent. 

If you just want to get a feel of what Yosemite is like, you can have someone take care of route planning, packing and permit organising! Check out <Camp Crate>(https://www.campcrate.net/trips/1-pohono-trail).

I'm absolutely in love with this business. I've done Pohono trail with my partner using Camp Crate and we had the best time.

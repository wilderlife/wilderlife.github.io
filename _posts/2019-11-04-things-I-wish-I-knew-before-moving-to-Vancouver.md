I’ve landed in Vancouver exactly 1 week +1 day from today. I was welcomed with the most beautiful sunny weather, huge community that's always up for a hike, and expensive mobile plan prices. Here are 10 things I wish I knew before arriving in Vancouver.

1.**Apply for jobs before arriving, use a VOIP service to get a Canadian phone number on your CV.**

There were two things I found out quite quickly about jub hunting in Vancouver: 
- not many employers will look at your CV unless you have a Canadian address and a phone number. 
- It will take a while for anyone to respond to you, so better start your job hunt early. 

If you want to apply before arriving in Canada you can try [Ring4](https://www.ring4.com). Ring 4 is a startup voted Product of the day (March 2017) at [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ring4). It allows you to generate a new Canadian number in seconds and receive calls overseas, with no roaming charges! Note that you will get charged when you want to call out, but usually, recruiters and employers will call you. It works on a credit-based system, so simply top up your account depending on how much you want to use it, starting from £1 per 10 credits. I used it for three weeks and it got me three interviews when I was still in London.

2.**You can find cheap accommodation in Vancouver, you just need to look harder - there is no SpareRoom or RightMove in Vancouver.**

After reading a lot of articles and Facebook posts about how hard it is to find an accomodation in Vancouver, I panicked and booked an Airbnb for 1 month (that’s £1000). If I would do this again, I would arrive on the 15th or the 1st of a month, book an Airbnb for 15 days and start the search before arriving. Most rentals start on the 1st or the 15th of the month. There are many groups where people sublet their rooms for 1-3 months at a cost of $600-800 per month (£400-600). 


Here are some groups you can join now:

3.**Don’t get scammed, people in Vancouver are so nice that your good judgement can get foggy!**

I find that it's really hard to judge people in Vancouver because everyone is very friendly and nice. On my 4th day in Vancouver, I went to a shop called AppleBerry in Mt Pleasant to buy a Public Mobile voucher. A sales assistant decided to help me out and set up the account for me while I was there (how nice:)), even though I didn't ask for it. Once finished he added a small fee to the total cost for his time ($20!). It was a bit of a shock, especially since I didn’t ask for his help. 
That leads me on to my 4th point:

4.**Choosing a mobile plan in Canada is difficult, but you will need it for job hunting.**

I was struggling with this one for a bit. After using GiffGaff in London for 6 years,I was used to paying £10 a month (6GB + Unlimited everything). Looking at Canadian mobile plans gave me a bit of a headache. There is no clear answer! Prices range from $40 - $110 and data plans are poor. I ended up going with Public Mobile - $40 for 5GB of data - because it had best reviews for the price and it is part of Telus (the main network provider here). But you should pick the right plan for you. Here is my thought process and a comparison of the pre-paid mobile plans in Vancouver.

5.**You can survive your first weeks just using a Revolut card - no need for prior Transferwise transfers.**

Travelling around without exchanging cash before arriving in a new country sounds a bit scary to some people, but not for me. I trust my wallet of fintech disruptors. You can withdraw money free of charge with Monzo, pay for everything with Revolut (including public transport), and put all your big spender moments on your Halifax MasterCard. Once settled down, you can open a bank account. CIBC seems to be everyone’s favourite, and it was super easy - all you need is your work permit and a passport.

6.**If you’ve activated your working holiday visa already and planning on flying to Vancouver, having a stop-over in Calgary might not be such a bad idea!**

Apart from being cheaper, it can be less stressful than a direct flight to Vancouver. When I first came to Canada I flew straight to Vancouver and I had to join a never-ending queue that kept us walking for a solid 10 minutes before we got to the registration machines. This time around, I had a stopover in Calgary and it was empty. No long queues, no questions, I didn’t even need to show my permit. The officer said something like: “Oh cool you’re coming to work here? That’s awesome, have fun!”. After that, you just take a domestic flight to Vancouver and you’re in!

7.**Bring your hiking shoes with you!**

If you're not a hiker you can skip this one. 
Clothes are expensive here and you will want to go on a hike once you arrive. So bringing hiking shoes is a good idea!

8.**Buy microspikes - it’s slippery here.**

It depends on what time of the year you choose to arrive in Vancouver, but hikes in October/November start getting slippery. If you're a cat-woman or a cat-man then you don't need them, but for me, it really helped especially on the narrower paths. It just makes you feel more comfortable. In winter walking paths in Vancouver can also get a bit sketchy. So once you arrive in Vancouver you can buy microspikes on Amazon or at MEC store.

9.**Everyone asks you if you brought cheese with you.**

Cheese in Canada is a. expensive and b. not so tasty for us Europeans, because they use pasteurised milk. So far I’ve managed to find some European brands of my favourite cheeses (blue stilton, brie, camembert), but if you’re after cheddar, mozzarella or gruyere, you will have a hard time finding it here (maybe in Whole Foods?). So to conclude, I wish I've brought cheese with me...

10.**Vancouver's community is awesome! You will make friends in no time!**
Moving to a different country all by myself was a challenge. However, one thing I was mostly concerned about was making new friends. What seemed like the biggest challenge at first, now feels like the least of my worries. In Vancouver, everyone is from somewhere but Vancouver! Compared to my first month in the UK, Vancouverians are up for hanging out, going for a hike, joining on an adventure! I’ve only been here one week, but I’ve already hiked up Mt Seymour with Women Who Explore Vancouver,and I'm going for a drink with someone who wants to know more about off-piste skiing. Here are some groups on Facebook and meet-ups you can join before arriving here that will help you meet new people instantly:

Overall after just one week in Vancouver I give this city a "Better than expected" rating. Vancouver is a welcoming city that’s stunning scenery will make you say “Wow!” at every corner. I still need to pinch myself to check that it’s not a dream, but I’m sure there are a lot of things about living in Canada that I will need to experience on my own skin.

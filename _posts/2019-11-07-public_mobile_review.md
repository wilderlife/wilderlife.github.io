title: Choosing a pre-paid mobile plan in Canada, British Columbia.
---

Choosing a mobile plan in Canada gave me a bit of a headache. All of them seem similar and well not so good compared to Europe. One thing I've learnt is to focus on data and not international minutes. For calling home use wifi or [Ring4](https://www.ring4.com){:target="_blank"} (Here's my Ring4 review)

Here is why I decided to go with Public Mobile.


**Public Mobile**
Community based network that was recently bought by Telus (the main network provider in Canada). Similarly to GiffGaff they don’t have a customer service hotline, so you will need to look for answers community forums. Just buy your SIM card at any of the stores (anchor link).


Pros: 
- Free $10 credit towards your next top up when using a [referral link](https://activate.publicmobile.ca/?raf=6ZMQ2N){:target="_blank"} or a code: 6ZMQ2N
- Cheap and reliable network: $40 (5GB at 3G Speed, - Unlimited Canada-wide Talk, - Unlimited International Text) I used it for 2 weeks now and had network everywhere even on hiking trails.
- Reward systems - help the community, get money off your next top up. 
- You get to pick your own phone number:)

Cons: 
- You can’t top up without a Canadian credit card, so you need to rely on the Vouchers bought at a store. (Once opening a bank, like CIBC you will get a credit card with no charges though!) 
- Here is a [list of stores](https://www.publicmobile.ca/en/bc/store-locator){:target="_blank"}, but my advice is go to Walmart and avoid small shops. 

I went to AppleBerry in Mt Pleasant, and a guy tried charging me $20 for setting up the account (I didn’t even ask him to do that!). You can perfectly set up the account yourself and top it up with a voucher online - it’s super easy! To open the account just visit [Public Mobile website](https://activate.publicmobile.ca/?raf=6ZMQ2N){:target="_blank"}
- No app to check how much data you have left, but you can either view it on your account online, or reset data usage every month on your phone. 

Looking at my mobile usage in the UK, I only needed 2+GB of data to make it through the month. Vancouver has a lot of hotspots everywhere, so whenever you’re at Save-On-Foods, Safeway, a bank or a coffee shop you can connect to the WiFi. I guess because I was part of a community based network for my 7 years in the UK, I’ve decided to go with Public Mobile especially because of the positive reviews and the price.

Starting your own Airbnb experience seems easy. All it takes is an idea and skills. Some ideas might work better than others, depending on the audience - da! But when I first started my Airbnb experiences in London, it didn't work at all. I had no bookings, no views, no interest. Then I moved to Vancouver and started over. Boom! Airbnb bookings began to fly in like crazy. Why? 

Here are ten things I've learnt from starting my first Airbnb experience:

1. **Will your idea attract people? Validate first.** 

Before starting my Airbnb experience for the second time, I began by looking at the Airbnb experiences in my area. For example in London, beer crawl tours or sightseeing bike trips were dominating. In Vancouver, hiking and multicultural cooking classes were the most popular. 

**Bonus:** I decided to ask the locals. And guess what? People in North America love dumplings - you can find them in every supermarket. Doing a little research gave me confidence that the pierogi making experience could fit the Vancouver audience. 

2. **Make sure to pick the best name.**

Picking a name for your Airbnb Experience, that will hit those SEO checkpoints, can be tricky. Being more specific can narrow down your audience, but also work to your advantage. 

Start by looking at the experiences similar to yours. How are their names structured? 

**Example:** I started with Polish Dumplings Cooking Class. For weeks, I received no searches or views. What I didn't realize, was that I should hit three key points: 
    a. What will you be doing?
    b. What will you get from it?
    c. Where will you be doing it?

So I decided to change the name to "Cook Polish Pierogies in North Vancouver.". Now, if you google "Polish Dumplings in North Vancouver." or  "Pierogies in North Vancouver." my experience is on the first page of google search. 

3. **On top of your expertise, showcase your credibility.**

In your "About" section, make sure you explain in detail why you are the person to teach this class. But also add some personal information about yourself. 

**Example**: *"Full-time, Margo works in a tech-startup in Vancouver, helping people find a life coach. Part-time, she is also a ski instructor at Mt Seymour."*. 

üëÜProviding this information will increase your credibility in the eyes of potential customers. Make your guests feel safe when they book with you. 

4. **Ask your friends and family for help.**

Once your first Airbnb experience is published, set your price low, open a couple of timeslots and ask your friends to book and be your first customers. Organizing your experience for your friends first is a perfect opportunity to do a dry run, boost your confidence and iron out any imperfections before your "real" bookings start flowing in. 

**Bonus: Ask your friends to leave your first reviews!**

5. **Always proactively ask for reviews and reply to them.**

After every experience, ask your customers to leave you a review. I usually send a message via Airbnb on the same day. Thanking them for coming, and sending a couple of photos from experience. 

**Example:**

"Hey, Katie! 

Just wanted to say again how lovely it was to host you at the pierogi class on Saturday. 

I hope you enjoyed the pierogi at home. I'm attaching some photos from the day, and the pdf of the recipe card to keep. 

I'm still growing my experience. And it would make my heart warm if you could leave me a review üôè

Have a fantastic beginning of the week, 

Margo."

After you receive a review, make sure to reply! Don't miss this opportunity to share even more about your experience publicly.

**Example:** "Thank you so much, Paulo. It was so nice getting to know you better. I've sent you recipes for other pierogi filling ideas. You can try them with your pierogies at home. I'm sure your family and friends will love it. Keep in touch!"

6. **Try to get as many super-reviews as possible.**

Airbnb is rating your performance based on your reviews. The more detailed the review, the higher the score. 

**Example:**
Super review: "Thank you to the beautiful Margo for such an amazing time! What better way to learn about Polish culture and food than making your delicious meal, leaving with a full belly and new friends! Margo was such an amazing host and welcomed us so warmly into her home. Our pierogies were amazing. I can't wait to take this skill back to Australia!" 

Good review: "Learning how to Make Pierogi in Vancouver is not something that we thought we would do in Canada, but when on holiday - always try something new! This class was an excellent value. Margo has a very personable and had a fun approach. It made the class very enjoyable and relaxing. We learnt how to make different kinds of pierogies. In the end, it was so much food, and it was all so delicious. Afterwards, we received a pdf of the recipes we made along with some other recipes too!! If your ever around Vancouver - I highly recommend for you try this! Worth it!". 

Both pretty detailed and long, but the first one hits all the key points Airbnb uses to measure your performance:
- Expertise - the knowledge, passion, and insight that hosts demonstrate during an experience.
- Insider access - the experience offers something unique guests couldn‚Äôt get anywhere else.
- Connection - guests felt welcome and cared for during an experience.

7. **Photos are key. Here is how to master them.**

Do you have a friend who's always been bragging about their photo skills and has a professional camera?Ask them for help. Entice them by offering your experience for free. Plus, they can get new interesting shots for their portfolio. Yeah, iPhone photos are great, but they are not the same. 

**Remember: Always ask your guests if it's ok to take pictures during the experience.** 

**Bonus: Send your guests the photos, after the experience. It's a fantastic souvenir.**

8. **Don't be afraid to play around with your pricing.**

After listening to ... and ..., I've learnt that pricing is always the toughest nut to crack. But with Airbnb, you get to manipulate your pricing as much as you like. 

Check the benchmark for experiences in your area and choose your price point. Go a bit lower to start with, and then steadily go increase the price as you get more reviews. 

**Bonus: Don't be afraid to go low!** The first bookings are not here to make money; they are here to build your credibility. 

9. **Keep all the receipts. And track your spending.**

Depending on where you live, you get taxed on your Airbnb experiences. From the ingredients to the tools you need, whatever you spend on making your business grow can be deductible from your tax.

10. **Underpromise and overdeliver.**

Less is more. Promising something you can't commit to delivering will only leave a sour taste in your guest's mouth. 

**Bonus:** I always message my guests a week before. Ask them why did they decide to book the experience. Then, I try to add a personal touch based on their answer. Be it a bottle of wine because it's their birthday, a special pre-meal snack, or a bouquet. Their pleasant surprise is an excellent first impression that will last. 


Overall, starting the Airbnb experience has been a fantastic adventure. It will take away all the stress if you treat it as a fun side-hobby rather than a full-time source of income. I've only opened up 2 Saturday's a month, so it doesn't feel like a strain - and guess what? People started to message me, asking if I can open slots for them.
